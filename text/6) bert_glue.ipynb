    "Here you can choose which BERT model you will load from TensorFlow Hub and fine-tune.\n",
    "There are multiple BERT models available to choose from.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - [BERT-Base](https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/bert_en_uncased_L-12_H-768_A-12/3), [Uncased](https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/bert_en_uncased_L-12_H-768_A-12/3) and [seven more models](https://tfhub.dev/google/collections/bert/1) with trained weights released by the original BERT authors.\n",
    "  - [Small BERTs](https://tfhub.dev/google/collections/bert/1) have the same general architecture but fewer and/or smaller Transformer blocks, which lets you explore tradeoffs between speed, size and quality.\n",
    "  - [ALBERT](https://tfhub.dev/google/collections/albert/1): four different sizes of \"A Lite BERT\" that reduces model size (but not computation time) by sharing parameters between layers.\n",
    "  - [BERT Experts](https://tfhub.dev/google/collections/experts/bert/1): eight models that all have the BERT-base architecture but offer a choice between different pre-training domains, to align more closely with the target task.\n",
    "  - [Electra](https://tfhub.dev/google/collections/electra/1) has the same architecture as BERT (in three different sizes), but gets pre-trained as a discriminator in a set-up that resembles a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN).\n",
    "  - BERT with Talking-Heads Attention and Gated GELU [[base](https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/talkheads_ggelu_bert_en_base/1), [large](https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/talkheads_ggelu_bert_en_large/1)] has two improvements to the core of the Transformer architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the model documentation linked above for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will start with BERT-base. You can use larger and more recent models for higher accuracy, or smaller models for faster training times. To change the model, you only need to switch a single line of code (shown below). All the differences are encapsulated in the SavedModel you will download from TensorFlow Hub."

In line with the BERT paper, the initial learning rate is smaller for fine-tuning (best of 5e-5, 3e-5, 2e-5)."
